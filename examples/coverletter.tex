\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Why Industrious?}
Industrious is filling a need for places where startups or teams can thrive. Supplying those spaces requires an understanding of what employees need, and how those needs being met allows them to do their best work. Modern technology can create insights into those needs, and simplify the process of delivering the best services possible.\\\\The position description presents a few key facts about working at Industrious that piqued my interest. First, it makes sense that the application of great working spaces will carry over to their own employees. Additionally, the described technologies show care has been taken in maintaining a robust and modern software stack. It sounds like it would be a pleasure to work at a place like Industrious.

\lettersection{Why me?}
I think I could be a great fit for the position at Industrious. My current position has given me a lot of experience building scalable micro-service web applications and APIs on Amazon Web Services. Our UI is built using AngularJS and our site back-end runs PHP using CodeIgniter. Our APIs serve tens of thousands of mobile application users, programmed in Python and supported by auto-scaling provided by Lambda and API Gateway.\\\\I have a passion for building things and learning new technologies. I get excited talking to other people about the things I'm making, and love shaking up my routine by helping open source projects when I can. I excel in locations that are varied and engaging while understanding the importance of work/life balance. I've been at my current company for several years and am looking to continue on with another company that shares these principles.

\lettersection{A bit more about me:}
I began learning web development before I was in high-school and have watched the web grow and mature over the last two decades alongside my own skills. Getting my degree at Stevens Institute helped round out my knowledge with a strong core of Computer Science fundamentals and teamwork. Since then, I've worked in a variety of businesses including IT in a large consulting firm, support for a middle-ware administration solution, and startups where I've built entire platforms from the ground up.
